## Introduction
SubKeep is a Chrome Extension that enhances Google Keep with advanced label and folder organization features.  
We respect your privacy and are committed to keeping your information safe.

## Data Collection and Storage
- **Local storage only.** All extension data (labels, preferences, UI state) is stored using Chrome’s built-in `chrome.storage.local` API. This data never leaves your browser or device.  
- **Error monitoring.** SubKeep uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for error reporting to help identify and fix bugs. These reports may include:
  - Technical details about the error (e.g., error messages, file paths, extension version).  
  - Limited environment details (e.g., browser type and version, operating system).  
  We do **not** collect personal or identifiable user content from your Google Keep notes.

## Permissions
- SubKeep only requests the minimum permissions required to function properly within Google Keep.  
- These permissions are used exclusively for providing the intended functionality (managing labels and sidebar customization).

## Third-Party Services
- **Sentry** is the only third-party service we use, and it is used solely for error monitoring.  
- SubKeep does not use analytics, advertising networks, or tracking scripts.

## Your Control
- You can remove all data associated with SubKeep by uninstalling the extension.  
- You may also clear extension storage manually through Chrome’s extension settings.

## Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If significant changes are made, we will update the “Last updated” date above.
