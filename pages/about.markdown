# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Stoyan!

I'm passionate about building apps and solutions that enhance everyday experiences. My journey into technology began with a curiosity for how code can solve real problems, and today, I'm focused on creating **intuitive, well-crafted digital products** that people actually want to use.

## ðŸ’¡ What I'm Building:

I'm constantly working on various projects, from mobile apps to web platforms. My latest focus has been [Green Compass](https://greencompass.app/), where I've been exploring how to build engaging user experiences that drive meaningful behavior change. I love the entire processâ€”from initial concept to shipping and iterating based on user feedback.

## âœ¨ What Drives Me:

- **Crafting Great Products**: Building apps with attention to detail and user experience.  
- **Independent Creation**: The freedom to explore ideas and build what I believe in.  
- **Continuous Learning**: Always picking up new technologies, frameworks, and design patterns.
- **Shipping & Iterating**: Getting products into users' hands and improving based on real feedback.

## ðŸš€ Beyond the Code:

When I'm not coding, I'm usually exploring new tools, reading about product development, or connecting with others like me. I believe the best products come from understanding both the technical and human sides of problem-solving.

Let's connect and build something awesome together! ðŸš€
