ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stoyan!

Iâ€™m an enthusiastic Android developer passionate about transforming ideas into functional, user-friendly mobile apps. My journey into tech began with a fascination for how technology solves real-world problems, and today, Iâ€™m driven to create meaningful solutions that inspire positive change.

ðŸ’¡ Why Iâ€™m Here:
Iâ€™m the creator of [Green Compass](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.act4zero.greencompass.android), a platform empowering individuals to live more sustainably. My mission is to bridge the gap between intention and action, offering tools and knowledge to help people make a lasting impact.

âœ¨ What I Bring to the Table:

* Proficient in native Android development with expertise in Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM).
* A dedicated learner, overcoming tech challenges with persistence and creativity.
* Motivated by innovation and solving real-world challenges through thoughtful solutions.

ðŸŒ± Beyond the Code:
Outside of app development, I stay active with occasional Jiu-Jitsu practice and cycling, which I use as tools to get into a flow state and recharge. I enjoy exploring new ideas, continuous learning, and finding ways to improve myself and the world around me. I believe technology, when used wisely, can be a transformative force for good.

Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, and build something extraordinary! ðŸš€
