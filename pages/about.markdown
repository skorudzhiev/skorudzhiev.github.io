# 👋 Hi, I’m Stoyan  

I build things that (hopefully) make life a little easier.  
My obsession with tech started with the classic *“what happens if I change this line of code?”* curiosity,  
and now it’s evolved into creating apps and platforms that people actually *use*.

## 💡 What I’m Building  
I like to keep myself busy (read: I can’t stop starting new projects).  
Right now, my spotlight is on **Green Compass** — a sustainability app with a not-so-boring mission:  
making eco-friendly habits stick without feeling like homework.  

Along the way, I tinker with web apps, mobile platforms, and occasionally games —  
because who doesn’t need an excuse to pop digital bubbles as a pangolin?

## ✨ What Drives Me  
- **Crafting Products That Don’t Suck**: Thoughtful design, clean code, and experiences people don’t rage-quit.  
- **Indie Spirit**: I like the freedom to build what I believe in (and the chaos that comes with it).  
- **Always Leveling Up**: New frameworks, new tools, new headaches—sign me up.  
- **Ship > Perfect**: Get it out, break it, learn, fix, repeat.

## 🚀 Beyond the Code  
When I’m not buried in a terminal or design doc, you’ll probably find me:  
- experimenting with new tools  
- reading about product development  
- doomscrolling my way through indie hacker threads

I believe the best products come from balancing the *human side* of problems  
with the *nerdy side* of solutions.

👉 Let’s connect, swap ideas, and maybe even build something awesome together.  
*(Worst case? We’ll at least complain together.)*
