I'm an experienced Android developer working in the FinTech industry with a focus <br/>on payment solutions for mobile apps.  

My technical career started as a System administrator supporting a large environment of mission-critical servers distributed across the world, while I was paving my way through the field of software development. For the period of 2017/2018, I've been accepted to participate in a Developer Challenge Scholarship sponsored by Google. <br/>
<br/>The provided opportunity had a significant impact on my ambition to thrive in the industry as later that year in 2018, I've released my first app on Google Play. I'm inspired by the opportunity to work on projects that drive social impact as a positive effect Ð¾n the community.
