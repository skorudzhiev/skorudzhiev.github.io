I am an experienced Android developer with more than five years of experience gained in the FinTech and recently Healthcare industry. I specialize in building innovative and user-friendly mobile solutions, aiming to enhance the user experience and streamline the product success. <br>

My technical journey began as a System Administrator, where I supported a large environment of mission-critical servers distributed across the globe. This experience instilled in me a strong understanding of server infrastructure, which complements my software development skills. <br>

My passion for technology and its potential to drive positive change led me to participate in the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship in 2017-2018. This program significantly fueled my ambition to enter the industry, and later in 2018, I successfully launched my first app on Google Play. <br>

I'm constantly motivated by the opportunity to create impactful solutions that not only address user needs but also contribute positively to the community. My ultimate goal is to leverage my technical expertise and passion to develop innovative mobile applications that empower users and make a lasting social impact.
