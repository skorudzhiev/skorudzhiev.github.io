# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stoyan!

Iâ€™m a **sustainability advocate** and **tech enthusiast** passionate about creating solutions that empower individuals and communities to make a positive impact. My journey into technology began with a curiosity for how innovation can solve real-world challenges, and today, Iâ€™m focused on bridging the gap between **intention and action** through thoughtful, user-friendly tools.

## ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™m Building:

Iâ€™m the creator of [Green Compass](https://greencompass.app/), a platform designed to make sustainable living actionable and accessible. By combining education, habit-building, and community engagement, Green Compass helps individuals turn small, daily choices into collective climate action.

## âœ¨ What Drives Me:

- **Mission-Driven Innovation**: Building tools that inspire meaningful change.  
- **Strategic Problem Solving**: Tackling challenges with creativity and persistence.  
- **Empowering Communities**: Enabling people to live sustainably with clarity and confidence.

## ðŸŒ± Beyond the Screen:

Iâ€™m constantly exploring ways to growâ€”whether itâ€™s learning new skills, reflecting on sustainability practices, or connecting with others who share a vision for a greener, better future. I believe that technology, when used wisely, is one of the most powerful tools we have to create lasting change.

Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, and shape a more sustainable tomorrow! ðŸš€
